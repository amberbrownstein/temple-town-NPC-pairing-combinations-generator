I developed this algorithm to help me come up with combinations of different pairings for a farming simulator I am creating.

Like many farming games, this one will allow the player to date and marry certain characters. However, each romanceable character (aside from ones who are secretly romanceable) will have 2 different romantic rivals. While romantic rivals will not prevent a player from being able to date or marry their character of choice, they can add difficulty if said NPC develops a closer relationship with a rival than the one that they have with the player.

Once the player marries their partner of choice, the remaining romanceable characters will start developing relationships with each other more deeply and eventually get married as well. As a result, each romanceable character has two assigned rivals so that each NPC will still be able to get married regardless of which one the player chooses to marry.

This algorithm helped me determine the most ideal rival assignments after denoting which rivals I like best for each character.

However, this is subject to change, as I may decide in the future that my personal ranking of pairings differs from my initial preferences.
