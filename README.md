I developed this algorithm to help me come up with combinations of different pairings for a farming simulator I am creating.

Like many farming games, this one will allow the player to date and marry certain townsfolk. However, each romanceable character (aside from ones who are secretly romanceable) will have 2 different romantic rivals in the initial release of the game. While romantic rivals will not prevent a player from being able to date or marry their character of choice, they can add difficulty if said NPC develops a closer relationship with a rival than the one that they have with the player.

Once the player marries their partner of choice, the remaining romanceable characters will start developing relationships with each other more deeply and eventually get married as well. As a result, each romanceable character has two assigned rivals so that each NPC will still be able to get married regardless of which one the player chooses to marry.

While additional pairings may be supported in the future as downloadable content, this algorithm helped me determine the most ideal rival assignments to set as the default for the initial launch, based on which rivals I like best for each NPC and the limitation of each character needing to be assigned exactly two rivals.

However, this is subject to change, as I may decide in the future that my personal ranking of pairings differs from my initial preferences.
